# New York City - The Conquest of Pestilence

The New York City (NYC) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene collects, analyzes and disseminates many types of health data as part of its mission to promote and protect the health of all New Yorkers. The Health Department provides data on its website through online publications, data tables and EpiQuery, its web-based, user-friendly system designed to guide users through basic data analyses on several datasets. EpiQuery Modules are based on health datasets with varying indicators for different NYC populations with SAS(r) statistical programs running behind the online interface to provide real-time results. Users can run cross-tabulations and find point estimates with confidence intervals. Here you can select from a small sampling of the EpiQuery data from the New York City Community Health Survey (CHS) and Vital Statistics Mortality Data.

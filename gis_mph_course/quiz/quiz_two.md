For this quiz, you have been provided with a shapefile representing the 42 United Hospital Neighborhoods in New York City and a Microsoft Excel document that contains data broken down into these same neighborhoods.  Using what you’ve learned so far in this course, you should feel comfortable with how to create a map when provided with this information.  However, this portion of the quiz is open book.  If you get stuck, you may refer to your text or other official course materials for guidance on how to proceed.

Please read the scenario below and prepare your map accordingly:

SCENARIO:  A colleague has asked your assistance in creating a map that shows the incidence of asthma ED visits by year against fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in New York City.  For this request, you should create a map that illustrates both these variables.  Using what you’ve learned so far in class, take care to create a map that shows both variables (hint: you can create one map with both variables overlaid or two side-by-side maps for this assignment).  

Specifically, your colleague has informed you that:

1)    Both variables should be broken into quartiles and symbolized appropriately.
2)    This map will be provided as a hand-out at an upcoming public event, with an audience that will not necessarily know much about the data or maps.
3)    You need to somehow identify the five neighborhoods with the highest prevalence of asthma ED visits on your map.  These five neighborhoods are near the community center where the event will take place.
4)    You will need to export your map into a file format that you can easily send your colleague for printing.

Once you have finished this assignment, please post your final exported map document and a map package (.mpk) in a ZIP file to the quiz drop box.  Make sure to include your name on your final map document.

(Asthma ED Visits (Youths and Adults) - Age-Adjusted Rate (per 10,000 residents), 2009

Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5) - Mean (mcg per cubic meter), Annual Average 2009  

Name: Asthma ED Visits (Youths and Adults) Measure: Age-Adjusted Rate How Calculated: Number of NYC resident youths and adults (15 years and older) summed within 5-year age groups, and divided by the population in each age group, using NYC DOHMH intercensal estimates; quotients are multiplied by the proportion of the 2000 US population in each age group. Age-adjusted rate is the sum of the weighted age-specific rates; expressed as cases per 10,000 residents. An ED visit is included if it has an ICD-9 principal diagnosis code of 493.

Name: Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5) Measure: Mean How Calculated: Air samples collected at specific NYCCAS monitoring sites along with information about emissions sources were incorporated into a statistical model that predicted pollutant concentrations at all locations in NYC for the specified time period. The results were then assigned to the appropriate NYC neighborhood and averaged. In NYCCAS, fine particulate matter is measured in units of micrograms per cubic meter of air.
